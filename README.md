**Sprint Retrospective**
 
What went well
 
A lot went well for our group throughout the whole process. The first thing that went really well was our overall communication. 
We met in person many times throughout the two weeks to work on the project and also discussed in our discord server on updates 
and progress we each made individually. Discord was our main way of communicating, where we discussed when and where to meet. We
also utilized whentomeet, another website that works very well to find times that all group members are free. Another thing that
went well is for our in-person meetings, all 4 group members showed up almost every time. This worked really well for us because,
while coding, each of us were on the same page and we could all collectively work together towards this final goal. Problem solving
was so much easier when there were 4 of us in a room together versus us working on the project individually. Another thing that
went really well for us is we made significant progress each time we met up which helped us reach our deadlines and kept us
motivated to keep working. We set deadlines and goals for ourselves at each meeting and successfully met them each time.
 
 
What didn't go well
 
Overall, we had a lot going right for us and not much that didn't go well. The one thing that didn't go that well for us was we
wasted some time at the beginning when the project was released. For the first 3 to 4 days after the project was finalized and
released, we didn't make much progress. During this time we could have been more productive so we wouldn't have had to work as hard
in the final days. We created a nice outline on the first day but never actually began working on the project. Another small thing
that didn't go well was we messed up pushing files once, which caused us to have to do extra work. After adding some small changes
while coding our project, we forgot, as a group, to push that to the main branch. This caused us, during our next meeting, to find
what we forgot to push and re-code it. In the grand scheme of things, it was a very minor error that didn't waste too much time, but
it is something that didn't go well for us.
 
 
What we can do better next time
 
I think overall our group did a very good job of working together and a lot went well for us. However, there are a few things that
could be done better next time. The first thing is we could have started working on the project right as it was released. Simply put,
we wasted precious time that could have caused less cramming and an overall smoother two weeks. The second thing that could have been
better is we could have used our resources and utilized the TA's and office hours more. We spent a lot of time during our meeting
group debugging and trying to fix problems. We had a lot of questions on why things didn't work and could have utilized the resources
around us to get help. Asking TA's questions would have sped our process up as a whole and would have allowed us to spend that saved
time in different areas. A final thing that we could have done better is we could have had better communication about which branch we
are working on. This caused some confusion and extra work to be done while we were coding. Better communication between us here would
have helped a lot.
