# DroneDeliverySystem
Drone delivery system that delivers a robot from one location to another and records the amount of time needed. Using the decorator design pattern, 
a timer function was added to the drone system. This timer is started whenever a drone reaches the robot and picks it up and ends when the robot is dropped off.
The addition of a timer to the base drone delivery system allows users to compare any time differences in the routing patterns available 
(beeling, depth first search, breadth first search, Dijkstra)
